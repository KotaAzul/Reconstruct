# Reconstruct Notes
## This document is intended to collect notes on the reconstruction of Reconstruct.

Early tests indicate that the Java implementation can handle the loading, zooming, and panning of large images very well!

Work is still progressing on the CodeBlocks compiled version. Parts of the Generalized Bitmap library have been compiled with CodeBlocks, but the rest of Reconstruct has not.

The Blender version requires TKinter for its GUI. TKinter may not be in all unbundled versions of Blender.
