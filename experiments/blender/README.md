# Blender Implementations
## 

The initial Blender implementation was written to eventually duplicate
the 2016 Workshop demostration used by CellBlender:

![CellBlenderModel](organelle_mcell.gif?raw=true "CellBlender Model")

That model was simulated with a series of fabricated "slices":

The slices were then (quickly) traced in Reconstruct to produce a 3D model:

The model was exported from Reconstruct as VRML 2.0 and imported into Blender:

The "Image Tracer" Blender addon displays one slice for tracing to eventually
build a full 3D model in Blender:
